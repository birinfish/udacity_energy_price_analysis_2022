# udacity_energy_price_analysis_2022

This is a project for Data scientist, a Udacity nanodegree program.
In this project, I conducted an analysis on the price developments of power and gas through the last two years,
answering the three questions as shown below:

Q 1: How much have the prices of energy commodities increased compared to 2021? </br>
Q 2: What could have been influencing factors for price changes? </br>
Q 3: Are the two different energy commoditiy prices(Electricity, Gas) correlated? </br>

The details about the analysis and the results are explained on the notenook "corr_analysis.ipynb".

Here is the structure of this project:</br>
 -dataset(folder): containing two datasets (csv fotmat)</br>
 -figures (result figures obtained from the notebook)</br>
 corr_analysis.ipyb (the main notebook where my model for the analysis was written)</br>
